            Jane Brocket is a woman of many talents. Rising to prominence in the domesticity scene back in <span class="strike">1907</span> 2007 with the publication of <a class="links" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gentle-Art-Domesticity-Jane-Brocket/dp/0340950986">"The Gentle Art of Domesticity"</a> following her hugely successful Yarnstorm blog, Jane has been a visionary and influencer before influencers even became a thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2020, Jane discovered the delights of jam making. Always a humble lady, she began with some simple apricots sourced from her local marche in Le Havre, as one does. As lockdown began and she found herself at a classic Brocket loose end, she delved deeper into the depths of jams, exploring new fruits (hello, chuckleberries) and techniques (goodbye, bad marmalade).

          </p>
          <p>
            As her ever faithful daughter/copycat/helper/number 1 fan, I found myself assisting in the labeling, ladeling, and application of lashings of jam to all edible surfaces. When I had to choose a project for this module, naturally a jamsite was the only option. And so, here we are.

            Please explore the (somewhat limited) site, chuck a cheeky Instagram follow - link in footer - and who knows, maybe one day we will actually <i>sell</i> some of this stuff, but don't get your hopes up!
